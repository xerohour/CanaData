## 2026-02-24 - Path Traversal in CSV Export
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled filenames in `csv_maker` allowed writing files outside the intended directory via `../` sequences.

**Prevention:** Always sanitize filenames using allowlists (alphanumeric, etc.) before using them in file operations, especially when they originate from user input.
