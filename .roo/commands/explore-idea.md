# Explore Idea

Research and validate a project idea through guided questions and analysis before starting implementation.

---

## Your Task

Guide the user through a structured research process to validate their project idea and gather requirements.

### Step 1: Understand the Idea

Ask the user to describe their project idea:

```
📋 Let's explore your project idea!

Please describe:
1. What problem does this project solve?
2. Who is the target user/audience?
3. What is the core functionality?
4. Any similar existing solutions you know of?
```

Wait for user response before continuing.

### Step 2: Technical Stack Research

Based on the user's description, identify technologies that might be relevant.

Ask clarifying questions:

```
🔧 Technical Stack

Current questions:
1. Do you have a preferred tech stack? (e.g., React, Next.js, Cloudflare Workers)
2. Any existing infrastructure or services to integrate with?
3. Database requirements? (SQL, key-value, object storage)
4. Authentication needed? (user accounts, login)
5. AI/ML components? (LLMs, embeddings, agents)
```

Wait for responses.

### Step 3: Check for Relevant Skills

Based on technologies mentioned, check if relevant skills exist:

Run: `/list-skills` or `roocommander search <keyword>`

Example searches based on common needs:
- Database: `roocommander search database`
- Auth: `roocommander search authentication`
- AI: `roocommander search ai`
- Cloudflare: `roocommander search cloudflare`
- Frontend: `roocommander search react`

Present findings:

```
🎯 Relevant Skills Found:

• [skill-name]: [what it covers]
• [skill-name]: [what it covers]

These skills can help with:
- [benefit 1]
- [benefit 2]

Would you like to review any of these skills? (Use /load-skill)
```

### Step 4: Scope and Complexity

Help user understand project scope:

```
📊 Project Scope Analysis

Based on your description, this project involves:

Features:
• [Feature 1] - Estimated: [time]
• [Feature 2] - Estimated: [time]
• [Feature 3] - Estimated: [time]

Complexity factors:
• [Factor 1] - [impact]
• [Factor 2] - [impact]

Estimated total: [X-Y hours development time]

Is this scope what you expected? Any features to add/remove?
```

Wait for user response.

### Step 5: Similar Solutions Research

Research existing solutions (if user hasn't already):

```
🔍 Similar Solutions

Let me search for similar existing solutions...

[Use web search or ask user to provide]

Found:
1. [Solution A]: [brief description]
   - Pros: [what it does well]
   - Cons: [limitations]

2. [Solution B]: [brief description]
   - Pros: [what it does well]
   - Cons: [limitations]

How will your project differ or improve on these?
```

### Step 6: Technical Feasibility

Assess technical challenges:

```
⚡ Technical Feasibility

Potential challenges:
• [Challenge 1]: [mitigation strategy]
• [Challenge 2]: [mitigation strategy]
• [Challenge 3]: [mitigation strategy]

Dependencies:
• [External service/API] - [availability/cost]
• [Technology] - [maturity/support]

Unknowns to research:
• [Unknown 1]
• [Unknown 2]

Any concerns about these challenges?
```

Wait for user response.

### Step 7: MVP Definition

Help define Minimum Viable Product:

```
🎯 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Core features for v1.0:
✅ [Essential feature 1]
✅ [Essential feature 2]
✅ [Essential feature 3]

Nice-to-have (v2.0+):
⏸️ [Future feature 1]
⏸️ [Future feature 2]

Does this MVP scope make sense? Any must-haves missing?
```

Wait for confirmation.

### Step 8: Resource Requirements

Outline what's needed:

```
📦 Resources Needed

Development:
• Time: [estimated hours/days]
• Skills: [required expertise]

Services/Tools:
• [Service 1]: [cost/tier]
• [Service 2]: [cost/tier]

APIs/Integrations:
• [API 1]: [free tier limits]
• [API 2]: [pricing]

Total estimated monthly cost: $[amount]

Budget concerns?
```

### Step 9: Decision Point

Present recommendation:

```
✅ Recommendation

Based on this exploration:

Pros:
• [Pro 1]
• [Pro 2]
• [Pro 3]

Considerations:
• [Consideration 1]
• [Consideration 2]

Recommendation: [Proceed / Simplify scope / Research more / Reconsider]

Ready to proceed with planning?

Next steps:
1. Run /plan-project to create implementation phases
2. Load relevant skills before implementation
3. Start Phase 1 of development
```

### Step 10: Summarize Findings

Create summary document (optional):

If user wants documentation, create a brief exploration summary:

```markdown
# Project Exploration: [Project Name]

## Problem Statement
[What problem this solves]

## Target Users
[Who will use this]

## Core Features
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

## Tech Stack
- [Technology 1]
- [Technology 2]
- [Technology 3]

## Relevant Skills
- [skill-name]
- [skill-name]

## MVP Scope
[What's included in v1.0]

## Estimated Effort
[X-Y hours development time]

## Next Steps
1. Run /plan-project
2. Load skills: [list]
3. Begin implementation
```

Save as `EXPLORATION.md` if requested.

## Error Handling

**Vague idea description**:
```
⚠️ Need more details to provide useful analysis.

Can you elaborate on:
- What specific problem does this solve?
- Who are the users?
- What's the core functionality?

Example good description:
"A chat interface for customer support that uses OpenAI to suggest responses,
stores conversation history in a database, and integrates with existing CRM."
```

**No tech stack preferences**:
```
💡 No problem! I can suggest a modern stack based on your requirements.

For [project type], I recommend:
- Frontend: [suggestion]
- Backend: [suggestion]
- Database: [suggestion]
- Hosting: [suggestion]

Does this sound good, or do you have other preferences?
```

**Overwhelming scope**:
```
⚠️ This scope might be quite large for initial development.

Current feature list:
- [10+ features listed]

Suggestion: Focus on MVP first
Essential: [3-5 core features]
Later: [remaining features]

Start smaller and iterate?
```

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ **Ask clarifying questions** (don't assume requirements)
✅ **Check for relevant skills** (use search/index)
✅ **Be realistic about estimates** (account for unknowns)
✅ **Define clear MVP** (avoid scope creep)
✅ **Research similar solutions** (learn from existing work)
✅ **Assess feasibility** (identify potential blockers early)

### DON'T

❌ **Don't skip scope discussion** (prevents misaligned expectations)
❌ **Don't assume expertise** (user may be learning)
❌ **Don't ignore similar solutions** (reinventing wheel)
❌ **Don't underestimate complexity** (better to overestimate)
❌ **Don't proceed without MVP definition** (scope will drift)
